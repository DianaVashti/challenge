Notes from e-mail:

This coding challenge is designed to assess your range of technical skills. We feel the exercise will allow you to demonstrate your CSS and HTML skills to build a simple, but visually appealing user interface that will be used to display a list of Asana tasks. Feel free to use any language that can be used to make an API request to Asana to display the user's tasks.

In addition to accomplishing the primary functions of the coding challenge, we hope that you'll use best coding practices like object-oriented principles, code commenting, organized file structure, use of build tools, etc. Feel free to reach back out with any questions!
